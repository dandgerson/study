Who This Book Is For

This book is ideal for you if you are a JavaScript developers who wants to gain expertise in OOP with JavaScript to improve your web development skills and build professional quality web applications.

## What You Will Learn

Master JavaScript's OOP features, including the one's provided by ES6 specification
Identify and apply the most common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, Model-View-Controller, and Mediator Patterns
Understand the SOLID principles and their benefits
Use the acquired OOP knowledge to build robust and maintainable code
Design applications using a modular architecture based on SOLID principles
In Detail

ECMAScript 6 introduces several new Object-Oriented features that drastically change the way developers structure their projects. Web developers now have some advanced OOP functionality at their disposal to build large-scale applications in JavaScript.

With this book, we'll provide you with a comprehensive overview of OOP principles in JavaScript and how they can be implemented to build sophisticated web applications. Kicking off with a subtle refresher on objects, we'll show you how easy it is to define objects with the new ES6 classes. From there, we'll fly you through some essential OOP principles, forming a base for you to get hands-on with encapsulation.

You'll get to work with the different methods of inheritance and we'll show you how to avoid using inheritance with Duck Typing. From there, we'll move on to some advanced patterns for object creation and you'll get a strong idea of how to use interesting patterns to present data to users and to bind data. We'll use the famous promises to work with asynchronous processes and will give you some tips on how to organize your code effectively.

You'll find out how to create robust code using SOLID principles and finally, we'll show you how to clearly define the goals of your application architecture to get better, smarter, and more effective coding. This book is your one-way ticket to becoming a JavaScript Jedi who can be counted on to deliver flexible and maintainable code.

## Style and approach

This comprehensive guide on advanced OOP principles and patterns in JavaScript is packed with real-world use cases, and shows you how to implement advanced OOP features to build sophisticated web applications that promote scalability and reusability.
